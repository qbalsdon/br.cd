The 5th and final project for my Udacious Udacity Nanodegree!

The aim of the project is as follows:
1. Allow users to scan barcodes and store them in groups. These codes and groups are accessable via the main screen of the app. 
2. The user will log in with their Facebook account and the codes and groups will be stored on a Parse (www.parse.com) server where they can be reloaded onto another device using the same account
3. The user will be able to view a group of barcodes using two methods: 
    a) A swipe based page view that renders the code in the middle of the screen
    b) A list view that will treat each code as an item on a checklist, this can be used for shopping or role call or stock take
